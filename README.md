## 📝 Overview

This project is based on **Port-MIS (Port Management Information System)** and aims to provide a **24/7 automated civil service chatbot** to handle inquiries related to port operations. By leveraging **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** and fine-tuning techniques, we have developed a domain-specific model called **Llama-3-PortMIS-Ko-8B** to deliver fast and accurate responses while reducing consultant workload.
